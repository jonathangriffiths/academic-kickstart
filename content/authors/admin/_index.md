I'm a computational biologist currently working in the therapeutics arm of Genomics plc.
I have combined an undergraduate education in cell biology with quantitative genomic skills acquired in my PhD, alongside an understanding of statistical genetics that I am learning at Genomics plc.
This provides me with an integrative and diverse set of skills to understand biological processes from modern, high-throughput datasets.

My PhD work was based in the Marioni lab in Cambridge, where I developed methods for single-cell RNA-sequencing data, and also led analyses around the generation of a single-cell RNA-seq atlas of mouse gastrulation.
